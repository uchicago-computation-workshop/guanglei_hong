**Abstract:** Causal mediation analysis in a multisite study is particularly intriguing because the researcher may not only test the program theory about intermediate mechanisms but also investigate whether these mechanisms operate differently across different contexts. In a series of studies, our research team re-analyzes the National Job Corps study, investigating whether Job Corps—the nation’s largest job training program for disadvantage youth—improved economic well-being through human capital formation, whether general education and vocational training were complementary or mutually reinforcing, and whether a wide array of supplementary services offered by Job Corps also contributed to the program impact. We develop new concepts and novel analytic strategies to overcome multiple methodological challenges in defining, identifying, and estimating the causal parameters and in sensitivity analysis.

**Dr. Guanglei Hong** is Associate Professor with tenure in the Comparative Human Development Department and the Committee on Education at the University of Chicago. She is an active member of the quantitative methodology community at the University. She obtained a Master’s degree in Statistics in 2002 and a Ph.D. in Education in 2004 from the University of Michigan.

Dr. Hong develops and applies causal inference theories and methods for evaluating educational and social policies and programs in multi-level, longitudinal settings. Her work is currently focused on developing concepts and methods for analyzing causal mediation mechanisms in multisite randomized trials. She has received research funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education, the William T Grant Foundation, the Spencer Foundation, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada.
